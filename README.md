# farmtimerJAVA
The original farm timer prototype created with Java and Java Swing. This was my first experience with coding user interface.
Main design flaw with this was not using MVC (Model, View, Controller), thus resulting in all of the UI and functions together in a single, big class file.
However, I learned a lot about how labels, panels, and how layouts worked. I understood how buttons can be coded with action events and binding functions to buttons. Personally, I was most proud of solving the problem of how to alternate timers, by initializing an integer object and using its value as a conditional to figure out which timer is active.
